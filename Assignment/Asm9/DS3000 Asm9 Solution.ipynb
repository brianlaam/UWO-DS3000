Specifically, you'll use two widely recognized pre-trained architectures—VGG16 and ResNet18—to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset. CIFAR-10 consists of 60,000 color images (32x32 pixels), evenly divided across 10 classes: airplane, automobile, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship, and truck.\n","\n","You'll apply transfer learning by adapting these pre-trained models to the CIFAR-10 dataset, train and evaluate both models, compare their performance.\n","\n","## Objectives:\n","- Understand and implement transfer learning.\n","- Train CNN models using pre-trained architectures.\n","- Unfreeze and fine-tune the final convolutional layer of each model.\n","- Evaluate and compare the performance of different CNN models.\n","- Analyze results with a confusion matrix."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"O6kSc0h8_iHX"},"outputs":[],"source":["# Import necessary libraries\n","import torch\n","import torchvision\n","import torchvision.transforms.v2 as v2\n","import torchvision.transforms as transforms\n","import torchvision.models as models\n","import torch.nn as nn\n","import torch.optim as optim\n","import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n","import numpy as np\n","from torch.utils.data import Subset, DataLoader, random_split\n","from sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix, ConfusionMatrixDisplay\n","import seaborn as sns"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"PZmKokh4_iHY"},"outputs":[],"source":["# Check if GPU (CUDA) is available, else use CPU\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"oD56KzON_iHY"},"source":["## Question 1: Dataset Setup and Exploration\n","1.
